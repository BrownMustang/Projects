          <p class = "details">Exercise is essential for maintaining physical and mental health. Regular physical activity strengthens muscles, improves cardiovascular health, and boosts overall energy levels. It also helps manage weight, reduces the risk of chronic diseases, and enhances mood by releasing endorphins. Incorporating exercise into daily routines promotes better sleep, reduces stress, and improves cognitive function, contributing to a higher quality of life.</p>


          <p class = "details">Here are the minimum activity ranges to aim for good health:</p>
